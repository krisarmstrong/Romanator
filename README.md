# Romanator: Converting Decimals to Romans
Romanator is a fun and useful C++ program that converts decimal numbers to Roman numerals. This program allows users to enter an integer in the range [1, 3999] and get the Roman numeral equivalent of that number. The program also includes input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid integer within the correct range. If the user enters an invalid input, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid input.

## Installation
To use Romanator, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. The program is implemented following the latest C++ guidelines, and should be compatible with most modern C++ compilers.

To install Romanator, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/krisarmstrong/Romanator.git

Usage
To use Romanator, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run the following command:

g++ -o romanator romanator.cpp

This will compile the program and create an executable file named "romanator". To run the program, enter the following command:

The program will prompt you to enter a number between 1 and 3999. Enter a valid integer and the program will output the corresponding Roman numeral.
